## Constructor Generator for C# Classes

## Overview

The Constructor Generator for C# Classes is a simple tool designed for generating constructor methods in C# class files. This project serves as a learning and experimenting ground for C# programming, providing a utility that automates the creation of constructors based on the fields present in a class.

## Features

- Parses C# class files.
- Generates constructors for C# classes.
- Supports basic data types and access modifiers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Installation

   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```
   dotnet run <ClassFileName.cs>
   ```

## Usage

1. Provide your C# class file as input.
